Hello, I’m Anthony Anaedu. I’m a Software Developer, IT Specialist and Engineer in Nigeria. I started my career in Information Technology as a Computer Support Specialist in 2007 and since then I learned that I had a passion for developing and providing digital solutions to various problems. 

I went ahead to get an M.Tech. in Information Technology, and a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I’m currently working at Audax Solutions as an IT Specialist/Trainer.

I’m a very curious and dedicated professional who loves to solve complex problems. I love computer programming, hacking technology, beautiful UI/UX design, travelling, music, learning and sharing knowledge. 

I pride myself on my ability to quickly learn languages/tools best for solving a problem. When I’m not coding or building websites, I’m probably reading, having a deep conversation, travelling, teaching kids/young adults how to code or training business owners on how to use WordPress.
