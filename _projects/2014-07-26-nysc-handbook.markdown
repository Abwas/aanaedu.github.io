The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Handbook application (app) hopes to aid the availability of the National Youth Service Corps Handbook. The project's focus is to ensure that prospective/currently serving NYSC Corps members and Nigerians in general have a working knowledge of the overall NYSC Scheme. 

This will also encourage the development of other booklets such as the NYSC bye-laws and many others, into Mobile APPS for easy accessibility.
Note: The text in this app is extracted from NYSC Handbook revised in 1999.
